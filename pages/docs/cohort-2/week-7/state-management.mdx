## Week 7.1

### Context API & Prop Drilling

In this lecture, Harkirat covers key concepts in React development, specifically focusing on routing, prop drilling, and the Context API. `Routing` is vital for managing navigation in React applications, while `prop drilling` and the `Context API` address challenges related to passing data between components. These insights provide essential knowledge for building well-organized and effective React projects.

### React Routing

Routing in React is a mechanism that allows you to manage navigation and control the content displayed in your application based on the URL. It's essential for several reasons:

1. `Multi-Page Applications (MPAs)`**:** In traditional web development, navigating between pages required a full page reload. React, being a Single Page Application (SPA) library, loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates the content as users navigate. Routing enables SPAs to mimic the behavior of traditional MPAs by updating the view based on the URL.

1) `User Experience`**:** Routing enhances the overall user experience by providing a seamless and dynamic interface. Users can navigate between different views or sections of your application without experiencing the delays associated with full-page reloads.

1. `Bookmarking and Sharing`**:** With routing, each view in your React application can have a unique URL. This allows users to bookmark specific pages or share URLs with others, making the application more user-friendly and SEO-friendly.

1) `Code Organization`**:** As your application grows, organizing code into separate components and views becomes crucial. Routing helps structure your code by associating components with specific routes, making it easier to manage and maintain.

1. `State Preservation`**:** When users navigate between different views, routing helps preserve the state of the application. React Router, a popular routing library for React, allows you to pass parameters and state between different components based on the route.

1) `Conditional Rendering`**:** Routing enables conditional rendering of components based on the current URL. Different components or views can be displayed depending on the route, allowing you to create dynamic and context-aware user interfaces.

> To implement routing in a React application, developers often use libraries like React Router. React Router provides a set of components and functions to define routes, handle navigation, and manage the application's history, making it an essential tool for building robust and navigable React applications.

## Some Jargons

### [](https://app.100xdevs.com/courses/3/154/187#c5dd5734d77245d88d8b932a538edc92 "1. SPA (Single Page Application):")1. **SPA (Single Page Application):**

A Single Page Application (SPA) is a type of web application or website that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current page, rather than loading entire new pages from the server.

- **Key Characteristics:**
  - Loads a single HTML page initially.
  - Subsequent interactions and navigation are handled by dynamically updating the content on the page through JavaScript.
  - Utilizes AJAX or Fetch API to communicate with the server and fetch data without reloading the entire page.
  - Provides a more fluid and seamless user experience by avoiding full-page reloads.

### [](https://app.100xdevs.com/courses/3/154/187#1bf94a03951c4fd6b64f793e2493cf21 "2. Client-side Bundle:")2. **Client-side Bundle:**

In the context of web development, a client-side bundle refers to a collection of JavaScript files and other assets bundled together to be delivered to the client's web browser.

- **Key Components:**
  - **JavaScript Files:** The application's logic and functionality are written in JavaScript files. Bundling involves combining these files into a single or multiple bundles.
  - **Stylesheets, Images, and Other Assets:** Along with JavaScript, other assets like stylesheets, images, and fonts may be included in the bundle for efficient delivery to the client.

* **Advantages:**
  - Reduces the number of HTTP requests, improving loading times.
  - Enables code splitting and lazy loading for optimizing performance.
  - Simplifies deployment and maintenance by organizing code into manageable bundles.

### [](https://app.100xdevs.com/courses/3/154/187#c890afb51db847b19e0546a98ba57e2b "3. Client-side Routing:")3. **Client-side Routing:**

Client-side routing refers to the process of managing navigation within a Single Page Application (SPA) entirely on the client side, without making additional requests to the server for each new view.

- **Key Features:**
  - Utilizes the browser's History API to manipulate the URL without triggering full page reloads.
  - Enables dynamic content updates based on the route, improving user experience.
  - Typically implemented using libraries like React Router for React applications or Vue Router for Vue.js applications.

* **Advantages:**
  - Enhances the performance of SPAs by avoiding the need for server round-trips during navigation.
  - Allows for a smoother and more responsive user interface as content is updated dynamically.
  - Enables bookmarking, sharing, and direct linking to specific views within the SPA.

### [](https://app.100xdevs.com/courses/3/154/187#054202150df24a0e9887589bc4cfbbf0 "React Router DOM")React Router DOM

In React, routing is commonly achieved using the React Router DOM library, which provides a set of components for handling navigation within a React application. The main components involved in React Router DOM are `BrowserRouter`, `Routes`, and `Route`. Here's an overview of how routing is typically implemented using these components:

### [](https://app.100xdevs.com/courses/3/154/187#1e5b22e91b5c4bd59bd7b25959bbb905 "1. BrowserRouter:")1. **BrowserRouter:**

- The `BrowserRouter` component is a top-level component that should be used to wrap your entire application. It enables the use of routing features throughout your React application.

* It utilizes the HTML5 History API to manipulate the URL without triggering full page reloads.

### [](https://app.100xdevs.com/courses/3/154/187#9d117b365cc741f091b5bc30634d14a9 "2. Routes:")2. **Routes:**

- The `Routes` component is used to define the routes for your application. Inside the `Routes` component, you specify individual `Route` components for each route in your application.

* The `Routes` component can contain multiple `Route` components, each representing a different view or page.

### [](https://app.100xdevs.com/courses/3/154/187#4ffe9bc3ee9040aebd723849e183667b "3. Route:")3. **Route:**

- The `Route` component is responsible for rendering specific components based on the current URL path. It takes two main props: `path` and `element`.

* The `path` prop defines the URL path that should match for the route to be rendered, and the `element` prop specifies the component to render when the path matches.

In the above example, when the URL path is "/", the `Home` component will be rendered.

> This is a basic setup for using React Router DOM. You can extend this by adding nested routes, handling dynamic route parameters, and incorporating additional features provided by React Router DOM for more advanced routing scenarios.

## Using React Router DOM

In a React app, creating a basic landing page and dashboard page with routing involves using React Router DOM to manage navigation. Here's a simple example:

1. **Install React Router DOM:**
   If you haven't installed React Router DOM, you can do so by running the following command:
2. **Setting up Routes:**
   Create two components for the landing page and the dashboard.
3. **Create the Main App Component:**
   Set up your main App component with React Router to handle routing.
   &#x9; In this example, we use the `Link` component from React Router to create navigation links. The `Routes` component contains Individual `Route` components for each page.
4. **Navigate Programmatically:**
   If you want to navigate programmatically, you can use `window.location.href`. For example, in a function:
   &#x9; However, using`Link` from React Router is a preferred way for declarative navigation within a React app.
5. **Shared UI:**
   If you want to share UI components between the landing page and the dashboard, you can create a common component and use it in both `Landing` and `Dashboard` components.
   &#x9; Import and use `SharedComponent` in both `Landing` and `Dashboard`.

> Via this example, we learn about a basic structure for setting up routing in a React app. React Router's declarative approach makes it easy to manage navigation and share UI components between different pages.

### Issue with `window.location.href`

When using `window.location.href` for navigation in a React application, it triggers a full page reload, which is not desirable in client-side routing. A full page reload involves fetching the HTML, CSS, and other assets again, leading to a slower and less efficient user experience.

To address this issue, React Router DOM provides a solution in the form of the `useNavigate` hook. This hook is designed for programmatic navigation within a React component without triggering a full page reload. By using `useNavigate`, you can ensure smoother transitions between different views in a single-page application (SPA) without unnecessary overhead.

Here's an example of how to use `useNavigate`:

> In this example, the `useNavigate` hook is used to get the `navigate` function, which can be called to navigate to different routes without causing a full page reload. By using this approach, you maintain the benefits of client-side routing in React, ensuring a faster and more seamless user experience.

### Note

The `useNavigate` hook in React Router DOM is designed to work within the context of a `BrowserRouter`. It should be used inside a component that is a descendant of `BrowserRouter` to ensure access to the correct router context. This limitation is intentional, as `useNavigate` relies on the router context for scoped navigation, enabling seamless client-side routing without triggering a full page reload. Placing the hook within the correct context ensures its proper functionality for dynamic view and URL updates.

## Lazy Loading

Lazy loading in React is a technique used to optimize the performance of a web application by deferring the loading of certain components until they are actually needed. This can significantly reduce the initial bundle size and improve the overall loading time of the application. In React, lazy loading is typically achieved using the `React.lazy` function along with the `Suspense` component. The `React.lazy` function allows you to load a component lazily, meaning it is only fetched when the component is actually rendered. Here's a simple example:

### [](https://app.100xdevs.com/courses/3/154/187#6840d7ead2634a8e958516fb71f53dd2 "React Suspense")React Suspense

In React, `Suspense` is a component that enables a better experience for handling asynchronous operations such as code-splitting and lazy loading. It's used in conjunction with `React.lazy` for lazy loading components or with data fetching functions.When you're using `React.lazy` to load a component lazily, you wrap it with `Suspense` to specify a fallback UI that will be rendered while the component is being loaded. The `fallback` prop of `Suspense` defines what to display during the loading period.

### [](https://app.100xdevs.com/courses/3/154/187#2c57ffcce0d24296ac981562cd7fe407 "Code Implementation")Code Implementation

In this example, if `MyLazyComponent` is not yet loaded, the `Suspense` component will render the "Loading..." message as the fallback until the component is fully loaded and ready to be displayed.

> This mechanism is particularly useful for improving the user experience when dealing with dynamic loading of components or fetching data asynchronously. The `fallback` UI gives users feedback that something is happening in the background, making the application feel more responsive.

## **Prop Drilling in React**

Prop drilling refers to the process of passing data from a top-level component down to deeper levels through intermediate components. It happens when a piece of state needs to be accessible by a component deep in the component tree, and it gets passed down as a prop through all the intermediate components.

### [](https://app.100xdevs.com/courses/3/154/187#d56416314e314447b0176dedf1109cb4 "Why Prop Drilling?")**Why Prop Drilling?**

1. **State Management:**
   Prop drilling is often used to manage state in a React application. By passing state down through the component tree, you can share data between components without resorting to more advanced state management solutions like context or state management libraries.

1) **Simplicity:**
   Prop drilling keeps the application structure simple and makes it easier to understand the flow of data. It's a straightforward way of handling data without introducing more complex tools.

### [](https://app.100xdevs.com/courses/3/154/187#a178b739d07f49e9ab16d0dfe5115def "Code Implementation")Code Implementation

In this example, `App` has a piece of data that needs to be accessed by `GrandchildComponent`. Instead of using more advanced state management tools, we pass the `data` as a prop through `ChildComponent`. This is prop drilling in action.

### [](https://app.100xdevs.com/courses/3/154/187#bbdf59a9e9e94e88a7e8e97ca017620e "Drawbacks")**Drawbacks**

1. **Readability:**
   Prop drilling can make the code less readable, especially when you have many levels of components. It might be hard to trace where a particular prop is coming from.

1) **Maintenance:**
   If the structure of the component tree changes, and the prop needs to be passed through additional components, it requires modifications in multiple places.

> While prop drilling is a simple and effective way to manage state in some cases, for larger applications or more complex state management, consider using tools like React Context or state management libraries. These can help avoid the drawbacks of prop drilling while providing a cleaner solution for state sharing.

## **Context API in React**

Context API is a feature in React that provides a way to share values like props between components without explicitly passing them through each level of the component tree. It helps solve the prop drilling problem by allowing data to be accessed by components at any level without the need to pass it through intermediate components.

### [](https://app.100xdevs.com/courses/3/154/187#eabe186ed92c41fdb66732840202d692 "Key Components of Context API:")**Key Components of Context API:**

1. `createContext`**:**
   The `createContext` function is used to create a context. It returns an object with two components - `Provider` and `Consumer`.
2. `Provider`**:**
   The `Provider` component is responsible for providing the context value to its descendants. It is placed at the top of the component tree.
3. `Consumer` **(or** `useContext` **hook):**
   The `Consumer` component allows components to consume the context value. Alternatively, the `useContext` hook can be used for a more concise syntax.

### **Code Implementation**

In this example, the `UserContext.Provider` in the `App` component provides the `user` object to all its descendants. The `Navbar` component, which is deeply nested, consumes the `user` context value without the need for prop drilling

### **Advantages of Context API:**

1. **Avoids Prop Drilling:**
   Context API eliminates the need for passing props through intermediate components, making the code cleaner and more maintainable.

1) **Global State:**
   It allows you to manage global state that can be accessed by components across the application.

> While Context API is a powerful tool, it's essential to use it judiciously and consider factors like the size and complexity of the application. For complex state management needs, additional tools like Redux might be more suitable.

## Other Solutions

Recoil, Redux, and Context API are all solutions for managing state in React applications, each offering different features and trade-offs.
